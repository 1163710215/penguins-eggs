# Ventoy

[Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) is an open source tool to create bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files.

Here we are using the RAW format for the virtual disks of our VMs. The images I am releasing are absolutely experimental and consist of a system image, placed on an 8GB RAW disk, on which the operating system and the patch for Ventoy was installed. Later the same file was zipped compressed for faster enjoyment via the Internet.

I currently created two images:

* arch-books
* debian-books

Copy the images on top of a flash drive with Ventoy already installed and you will have in addition to your isos, machines that while limited, are R/W until the disk is replenished.

The possibilities for use are endless, as are those for customization, as you can add packages and data.

Enjoy
