# eggs cuckoo

The cuckoo lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, and the eggs are hatched by the latter. Similarly eggs can start a self-configuring PXE service to allow you to boot and install your iso on third party networked computers. Command cuckoo can be used either to deploy a newly created iso on an installed system or by live booting the iso itself. 

This is the first implementation of cuckoo, based on dnsmasq. I would have liked to implement it interament in node, so far it has not been possible.

Given the need to install the dnsmaq and pxelinux packages cuckoo is currently only available for Debian/Devuan/Ubuntu. I plan to externalize its compatibility to manjaro and Arch distributions soon.

# TO DO

* add UEFI capabilities
* add Arch and manjaro compatibility
