* releasing v9.4.5



# Penguins' eggs Debian TESTING packages

Please, don't use this package for installations, they have just the pourpouse to be TESTED and can be extremally BUGGED!!!

# OEM Installation (soon I hope)
I'm trying to create an OEM installation for eggs, in order to allow configuring pre-installed computers where the user gets a simple configuration program on first boot.

## Krill
An OEM installation is divided into two phases, the first to be carried out in the company is the pre-installation which installs the operating system by configuring it with a live user, the second is the final configuration phase which takes place after delivery to the user.

The first phase can be performed very well by krill that I have cleaned and prepared for the purpose and takes place in CLI, unattend and configurable mode. On this side I'm already at a good point. 

We will have: ```sudo eggs install --oem```

## Sepia: first access system configurator
For the second phase I'm writing a dedicated program using nodejs, typescript, react, electron.io and material-ui.

Since krill is already - albeit with a CLI interface - it was written with react, I already have a clear idea of what needs to be done and I progress quite quickly, but of course I run into the lack of experience in the GUI world.

At the moment I'm looked to find a way to read/write local configuration files and how to add i10n to the program. Yes, here I'm absolutely beginner, but like and have great ideas in this platform.

So I was asking you if you have knowledge of this matter in order to collaborate in the construction of the application.

## Our mascote

Chasing [calamares](https://calamares.io/), I have already chosen as a mascot for my CLI installer the name of [krill](https://penguins-eggs), continuing in the line here is [sepia](https://github.com/pieroproietti/sepia)
