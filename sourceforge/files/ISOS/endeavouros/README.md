# Penguins' eggs remastered ISOs

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

# EndeavourOS

[EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) a terminal-centric distro with a vibrant and friendly community at its core

* **egg-of-endeavouros-rolling-xfce** A light xfce4 

# Calamares
Here we are using calamares from aur, installing calamares from pacman don't work.

It's possible to install [calamares](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/calamares-git) by yay, but at the moment there is a problem with package [ckbcomp](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ckbcomp), so to install calamares, you will have to:
```
git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs-pkgbuilds
cd penguins-eggs-pkgbuilds/aur/cbkcomp
makepkg -si
```

At this point you can properly install calamares with the command: 

```
yay calamares
```

We need now to reconfigure eggs:

```
sudo eggs dad -d
```

and let eggs configure it to allow the use of calamares without entering the root password:

```
sudo eggs calamares --install
```

We are ready to create our first iso:

```
sudo eggs produce
```

If you want calamares and eggs to be removed during system installation, simply use:

```
sudo eggs produce --release
```

# Installing EndeavourOS via PXE

One feature of ISO images made with eggs is the ability to be used for network installation . All you have to do is boot the ISO to be installed, open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo eggs cuckoo```.

Then all you have to do is boot from the network the machines to be installed and start the calamares or krill installer.

You can also perform an unattended installation with krill, see the [manual](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/english) or, find assistance in the [telegram Penguins' eggs](https://t.me/penguins_eggs) group.

## Note
In EndeavourOS - at the moment - I was able to boot via PXE just on BIOS system not UEFI. I hope someone can suggest a way to fix it to can boot via PXE on UEFI machines too.

# Disclaim

__Please note what this project is in no way connected to the original distro in any official way, itâ€™s just my personal experiment.__
