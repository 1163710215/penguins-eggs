## **naked**
Just the juice, without GUI. You can start here to build your revolution!

Note: I didn't find a clean way to get a clean Ubuntu 22.04 CLI only as I do with Debian/Devuan, I tryed with Ubuntu server edition minumun and stardard installation, but always there are delay on start of the live due a wait for networking. If someone know the issue can be kind do advice me for the problem.
