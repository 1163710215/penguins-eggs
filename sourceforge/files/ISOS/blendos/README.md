# Calamares notes
To be able to install remastered blendOS, we need calamares@3.2.61-1 in aur.

I don't know why it's not reconnized by yay here, in all the way just:

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/calamares.git
cd calamares
makepkg -si
```

# Disclaim

__Please note what this project is in no way connected to the original distro in any official way, itâ€™s just my personal experiment.__
