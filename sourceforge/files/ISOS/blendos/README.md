# Note
I use to create this remaster [chaotic-aur](https://aur.chaotic.cx/) where I get calamares and also penguins-eggs, once it's released.

At the moment I'm doing a job of "adapting" penguins-eggs to [blendOS](https://blendos.co/), being a rather particular distribution, especially for immutability.

This, as I understand it, is handled by the [`akshara`](https://github.com/blend-os/akshara) hook which I then remove in favor of the [`blend`](https://github.com/blend-os/blend) hook as was the case for the first version. It's right? It's not right? I don't know at the moment, also I plan to write a theme that resets to akshara on the installed system.

That said, in a nutshell, this blendOS remaster is absolutely not the original it's my attempts to understand it that push me and I don't know yet where they will lead.

Also, while for the other iso I normally use the released version of penguins-eggs, for this - since I'm working on it . normally the version of penguins-eggs is not the current one but an advance of the future version.
