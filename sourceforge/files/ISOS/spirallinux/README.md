# Penguins' eggs remastered ISOs

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All the ISOs include nodejs and eggs installed (.npm package), so you can update your eggs tool with the command:

```sudo eggs update```

# SpiralLinux remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on [SpiralLinux](https://spirallinux.github.io/)

SpiralLinux is a selection of Linux spins built from Debian GNU/Linux, with a focus on simplicity and out-of-the-box usability across all the major desktop environments. SpiralLinux serves as an alternative live installation method for a highly reliable customized Debian system using only official Debian package repositories.

I wish this distribution great popularity because it is based on good principles: making Debian immediately usable for the masses and introducing btrfs.

This remastering of mine, however, does not contain the btrs part, it will be installed as ext4, I will see about recovering this very important characteristic in the future.
