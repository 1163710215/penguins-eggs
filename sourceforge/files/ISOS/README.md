# Penguin's eggs remixes ISOs

All ISOs are based on Arch, Debian, Devuan, Linuxmin, manjaro and Ubuntu.

You can boot this live images burning them on USB key - using [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) is a great opportunity - or via PXE, booting from LAN, just ```sudo eggs cuckoo``` or  ```sudo eggs cuckoo --real```

To install the system you have:

* GUI installer calamares
* TUI installer krill
* unattended

## user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All the ISOs include eggs >= 9.2.5 installed

I removed a lot of old images to have all the production capable to boot in traditional way or by PXE just launch: ```sudo eggs cuckoo` and boot other machine on the LAN from the network.

Arch and manjaro images are at the moment excluded from cuckoo, soon I will include them.

```sudo eggs update```
