# Plastilinux
Plastilinux would like to become a meta-distribution for school and be based on different custom Linux distributions using the [wardrobe](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-wardrobe/tree/main/DOCUMENTATION#penguins-wardrobe) of [eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs).

# Integration with epoptes.
I have included in eggs an integration function with [epoptes](https://epoptes.org/), thanks to which from an installed machine, creating an image with ```sudo eggs produces --fast`` and starting ``sudo eggs cuckoo`` the machines started via PXE can be controlled with [epoptes](https://epoptes.org/).
