# Penguins' eggs remastered ISOs

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All ISOs include eggs, you can udate it with: ```sudo eggs update```.

# Arch

[Arch](https://archlinux.org/) a simple, lightweight distribution.

* **egg-of-arch-rolling-naked** Just the juice, without GUI. You can start here to build your revolution!
* **egg-of-arch-rolling-colibri** A light xfce4 for developers you can easily start to improve eggs installing colibri.

# USE

**naked** can be usefull to start everything: just add that you want, **colibri** is more a tool to hack with eggs than a real customization and perhaps can be used to test calamares too. 

NOTE: While waiting to complete the wardrobe for arch, it is still possible to switch from the naked configuration to colibri by running the following commands:

* ```eggs wardrobe get```
* ```cd .wardrobe/costumes/colibri```
* ```sudo ./arch-colibri.sh```

# Installing eggs and producing an iso 
You can use yay:

```
yay penguins-eggs
```
or, more traditionally:

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/penguins-eggs.git
cd penguins-eggs
makepkg -srcCi
```

Eggs, is installed!

# Installing calamares

It's possible to install calamares by yay too, but at the moment, 
there is a problem with [ckbcomp](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ckbcomp) on AUR.

So, just clone my version [ckbcomp](https://github.com/pieroproietti/ckbcomp), and:
```
git clone https://github.com/pieroproietti/ckbcomp
cd ckbcomp
makepkg -srcCi
```

Then install calamares with yay:

```
yay calamares
```

We need now to reconfigure eggs:

```
sudo eggs dad -d
```

and let eggs configure it to allow the use of calamares without entering the root password:

```
sudo eggs calamares --install
```

At this point we are ready to create our iso:

```
sudo eggs produce
```

If you want calamares and eggs to be removed during installation, simply use:

```
sudo eggs produce --release
```

# Creating naked starting from archiso
See [arch-naked](https://penguins--eggs-net.translate.goog/book/arch-naked?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en)


# Installing Arch Linux via PXE

One feature of ISO images made with eggs is the ability to be used for network installation . All you have to do is boot the ISO to be installed, open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo eggs cuckoo```.

Then all you have to do is boot from the network the machines to be installed and start the calamares or krill installer.

You can also perform an unattended installation with krill, see the [manual](https://penguins-eggs.net/book/) or, find assistance in the [telegram Penguins' eggs](https://t.me/penguins_eggs) group.

## Note
In Arch - at the moment - I was able to boot via PXE just on BIOS system not UEFI. I hope someone can suggest a way to fix that and boot via PXE on UEFI machines too.
