# Penguins' eggs remastered ISOs

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All ISOs include eggs, you can udate it with: ```sudo eggs update```.

# Arch

[Arch](https://archlinux.org/) a simple, lightweight distribution.

* **egg-of-arch-rolling-naked** (1,8 G compression fast)
* **egg-of-arch-rolling-colibri** (2,4G compression fast)

**naked** can be usefull to start everything: just add that you want, **colibri** is more a tool to hack with eggs than a real customization and perhaps can be used to test calamares too. 

NOTE: While waiting to complete the wardrobe for arch, it is still possible to switch from the naked configuration to colibri by running the following commands:

* ```eggs wardrobe get```
* ```cd .wardrobe/costumes/colibri```
* ```sudo ./arch-colibri.sh```

# Installing eggs and producing an iso 

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/penguins-eggs
cd penguins-eggs-manjaro
makepkg -srcCi
```

Eggs, is installed!

We can autoconfigure it, with the help of dad:

```
sudo eggs dad -d
```

And produce our iso:

```
sudo eggs produce --fast
```

and You will get your remasterd iso installable with krill.

# Installing calamares

## prerequisites
We need: ttf-comfortaa, ckbcomp and mkinitcpio-openswap as they are dependencies.

Let's install them.

### ttf-comfortaa
```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/ttf-comfortaa.git

cd ttf-comfortaa

makepkg -srcCi
```

### ckbcomp
```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/ckbcomp.git

cd ckbcomp

makepkg -srcCi
```

### mkinitcpio-openswap

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/mkinitcpio-openswap.git

cd mkinitcpio-openswap

makepkg -srcCi
```

## build calamares
```
git clone https://gitlab.manjaro.org/packages/extra/calamares

cd calamares

makepkg -srcCi
```

At this point we need to reconfigure eggs:

```
sudo eggs dad -d
```

and let eggs to configure calamares to get used without password:

```
sudo eggs calamares --install
```

At this point we are ready to create our iso:

```
sudo eggs produce --fast
```

If you want calamares and eggs to be removed during installation, simply use:

```
sudo eggs produce --fast --release
```

# Installing Arch Linux via PXE

One feature of ISO images made with eggs is the ability to be used for network installation . All you have to do is boot the ISO to be installed, open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo eggs cuckoo```.

Then all you have to do is boot from the network the machines to be installed and start the calamares or krill installer.

You can also perform an unattended installation with krill, see the [manual](https://penguins-eggs.net/book/) or, find assistance in the [telegram Penguins' eggs](https://t.me/penguins_eggs) group.

## Note
In Arch - at the moment - I was able to boot via PXE just on BIOS system not UEFI. I hope someone can suggest a way to fix that and boot via PXE on UEFI machines too.
