# Penguin's eggs remastered ISOs

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All ISOs include eggs, you can udate it with: ```sudo eggs update```.

# Arch

[Arch](https://archlinux.org/) a simple, lightweight distribution.

* **egg-of-arch-rolling-naked** (1,8 G compression fast)
* **egg-of-arch-rolling-colibri** (2,4G compression fast)

**naked** can be usefull to start everything: just add that you want, **colibri** is more a tool to hack with eggs than a real customization and perhaps can be used to test calamares too. 

NOTE: While waiting to complete the wardrobe for arch, it is still possible to switch from the naked configuration to colibri by running the following commands:

* ```eggs wardrobe get```
* ```cd .wardrobe/costumes/colibri```
* ```sudo ./arch-colibri.sh```
