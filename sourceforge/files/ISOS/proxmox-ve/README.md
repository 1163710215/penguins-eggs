# Proxmox-VE remastered ISOs
Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE; short PVE) is an open-source server virtualization management platform. It is a Debian-based Linux distribution and allows deployment and management of virtual machines and containers. Proxmox VE includes a web console and command-line tools, and provides a REST API for third-party tools. Two types of virtualization are supported: container-based with LXC (starting from version 4.0 replacing OpenVZ used in version up to 3.4, included), and full virtualization with KVM. It comes with a bare-metal installer and includes a web-based management interface.

All ISOs are based on Proxmox VE 6.3

# Proxmox VE 7.1 

* **pve** - It is a simple remastered version of Proxmox VE 7.1, dressed with XFCE4, firefox, virt-viewer

You can use live or install as your workstation to get the power of PVE. Of course, you can add firmware you need and remaster it again, or start with the cli version and add your tools.
