# Installing manjaro Linux via PXE

One feature of ISO images made with eggs is the ability to be used for network installation . All you have to do is boot the ISO to be installed, open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo eggs cuckoo```.

Then all you have to do is boot from the network the machines to be installed and start the calamares or krill installer.

You can also perform an unattended installation with krill, see the [manual](https://penguins-eggs.net/book/) or, find assistance in the [telegram Penguins' eggs](https://t.me/penguins_eggs) group.


## Note
In manjaro - at the moment - I was able to boot via PXE just on BIOS system not UEFI. I hope someone can suggest a way to fix that and boot via PXE on UEFI machines too.
