* **egg-of-ubuntu-impish-waydroid** - remastered version from ubuntu-20.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso (minimum installation)
* **eggs-of-debian-bookworm-waydroid** - it's not a naked version! Made for developers to not get crazy with X11 dependencies, it not use a Deskop Manager like (sddm, gdm3, etc), but you need to login from console and run ```startplasma-wayland``` to get GUI. 
* **eggs-of-debian-bullseye-rebecca** - remastered from [RebeccaBlackOS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rebeccablackos/) from [nerdopolis](https://sourceforge.net/u/nerdopolis/profile/), see on [Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=rebeccablackos), work on UEFI and BIOS standard. To install Rebecca: login as ```live```, password ```evolution```, choose KDE and run from a terminal: ```wlsudo calamares```.

**Note:** Please, use always ```theme=waydroid```
