# Penguin's eggs remixes ISOs

All ISOs are based on Debian Buster, Ubuntu Focal, Linux Mint 19.x and Deepin 20 Beta. 

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All the ISOs include eggs installed (deb package). You can update your eggs tool with the command:

```sudo eggs update```

# Linux MX

* **egg-of-mx-buster-kde-amd64** - remaster of MX19
* **egg-of-mx-bullseye-xfce-amd64** - remaster of MX21


I'm playing with it and trying to add eggs support to mx-installer to see if it is possible to use it for others Debian based distros. 
At the moment this is the result:

* **egg-of-debian-bullseye-xfce-amd64** - 

This is a standard Debian bullseye xfce - not MX - with the possibility to be installed with: krill, mx-installer and calamares and remastered with eggs.

# Disclaim
__Please note what this project is in no way connected to MX-Linux in any official way, itâ€™s just my personal experiment__.
