# Hic sunt leones...

After Debian/Devuan/Ubuntu I decided to bring eggs under Arch and thanx to the collaboration of stefano@manjaro.com
we was able to remaster linuxmanjaro since january 2022.

eggs was on AUR from an age, thanx someone create the PKGBUILD from the amd64 Debian edition.

eggs was in manjaro community until June 2022, after it [was removed](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/penguins-eggs-help-needed-for-manjaro-compatibility/96799/20?u=artisan).

Unfortunately I have not mantainer authorizations in manjaro, so I started to buld a new PKGBUILD here because want optimize PKGBUILD of eggs amd have it complete, streamlined, and compliant with manjaro policies and eggs.
