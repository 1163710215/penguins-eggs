# Hic sunt leones...

After Debian/Devuan/Ubuntu I decided to bring eggs under Arch and thanx to the collaboration of stefano@manjaro.com
we was able to remaster linuxmanjaro since january 2022.

eggs was in community until June 2022, after which it was removed due to compatibility issues. I started because of this to try to optimize the PKGBUILD of eggs to make it complete, streamlined, and compliant with manjaro policies.
