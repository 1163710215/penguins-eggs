# eggs unattended install

Eggs unattended install Is based on simple scripts:
* ```eui-create-image.sh``` creates the image;
* ```eui-start.sh``` is copied into ```/usr/bin/```
* ```eui-users``` contains the list of users enabled to sudo WITHOUT password, it is copied to ```/etc/sudoers.d/```;
* ```eui-autostart-[xfce/cinnamon].desktop``` starts automatic installation at login and is copied to ```/etc/xdg/autostart```.

The three files `eui-start.sh`, `eui-users` and `eui-*.desktop` are deleted from the destination directory as soon as the production of the image is completed

# Creation of an EUI image
To create an ISO with unattended-install capability, proceed as follows:

```
cd /usr/lib/penguins-eggs/eui
```
If necessary, modify the `eui-start.sh` file `sudo nano eui-start.sh` to select the desired language, swap configuration, and other possible configurations given in the source. 

Save and start the image creation:
```
./eui-create-image.sh
```

An image with fast compression will be generated, and the cuckoo command will be started to distribute it.

**Note:** once the image is created. simply start 'eggs cuckoo' to distribute it, no need to regenerate it


# Differences of a UEI image versus a normal image

Self-starting of the installer is done through the following files:

* /etc/sudoers.d/eui-users
* /etc/xdg/autostart/eui-[xfce/cinnamon].desktop
* /usr/bin/eui-start.ch

You can select a particular customization or create your own, at the moment I am trying to adapt the customization to the various languages and we have:

* bg (Bulgarian)
* br (Brazilian Portuguese)
* de (German)
* es (Spanish)
* fr (French)
* it (Italian)
* nl (Dutch)
* pe (Spanish Peru)
* ru (Russian)
* uk (ukrainian)

## /etc/sudoers.d/eui-users

It is copied inside `/etc/sudoers.d`, MUST be owned by root and have rights 0440

```
live ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
artisan ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

##  /etc/xdg/autostart/eui-autostart-[xdce/cinnamon].desktop
It is the file that makes it possible to auto-start the installer: there are currently two working versions, one for XFCE and one for cinnamon;

    sudo rm -f /usr/bin/eui-start.sh
    sudo rm -f /etc/xdg/autostart/eui.desktop
fi
```
**Note:** look at the new `--halt` flag, introduced to shut down the machine after installation and avoid. thus, further attempts in the case of PXE-enabled computers and with first PXE boot device.

I am not very skilled at producing movies, even less so as an actor, I made this [video](https://youtu.be/QBjkxxoc8ho) I hope it will help you.
