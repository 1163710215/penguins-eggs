### eggs-9.1.16-1
* wardrobe: changed the way to get SUDO_USER this fix a bug finding ~/.wardrobe in Ubuntu
* wardrobe: wardrobe now install debs depending on the distro, this made possible to have an unique costume/accessory for more distros. Example: we have now just an accessory for waydroid not three differents versions (bullseye, bookworm, jammy). 

### eggs-9.1.15-1
* wardrobe: the configuration scripts of the various: gdm3, lightdm, sddm are now common to all costumes.

### eggs-9.1.14-1
I made some modifications in the way to build eggs, trying to reduce the times of compiling it:
* using [verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) private proxy registry;
* replacing npm with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as package manager.

### eggs-9.1.13-1
* gdm3 autologin in live for Debian/Devuan fix

### eggs-9.1.12-1
* wardrobe: removing sources.list control on Ubuntu (use different schema) and testing a lot with Ubuntu 22.04. I did'nt find clean way to get a clean Ubuntu 22.04 CLI only installation as I do with Debian/Devuan,  tryed with Ubuntu server edition minumun and stardard installation, but always there are delay on start of the iso due a wait for networking.

### eggs-9.1.11-1

* commands: removed command bro, removed all command aliases to reduce confusion, re-estabilish warming if a command need to be called with sudo

### eggs-9.1.9-1

* bugfix: wardrobe verions 9.1.8 due a bug don't find accessories.

### eggs-9.1.8-1
wardrobe: the syntax of the wardrobe commands has been modified: in particular the costume flag has been removed and the COSTUME is passed as argument of the command. The default wardrobe is now saved in ~/.wardrobe. Costumes are now included in the wardrobe costumes directory, this creates a better organization of the wardrobe. We are near to be stable.

### eggs-9.1.7-1
* installers: A new idea it's taking form, using wardrobe I added the nice Linuxmint LMDE installer to same custom version - mostly bullseye and chimaera and the result was positive. So now we have 3 different installation possibilities for our iso: krill for CLI systems, live-installer and calamares for GUI systems.

### eggs-9.1.6-1
* bugfix and a new idea

### eggs-9.1.5-1
* wardrobe: try 5 times if apt-get install fail before to exit. Tested against colibri, owl and eagle, the remain problem it's just desktop background.

### eggs-9.1.1-1
* wardrobe: added distributions, as an array of [bullseye, bookworn, chimaera, etc] to limit usage of costumes ans accessories just on the appropriate distros.

### eggs-9.1.0-1

A breacking news!

* wardrobe: after a bit of consolidation, I moved the suddivision of firmwares from the code to the wardrobe organization. ```firmwares``` now is a accessory with same own internal accessories. 
* accessories: now accessories can be external and internal. Internal accessories live inside the costume, for example  inside firmwares live codecs, network-cable and so on. Internal accessories have suffix: ```./```: ```./codecs```, ```./network-cable```, etc.
* If you open ```wardrobe.d/accessories/firmwares```, you can find inside: codecs, network-cable, printers, video-nvidia, network-wifi, video-amd and ou are free to add others. 

This result in a great semplification of code and a improved organization. Just adding others firmware categories inside firmwares - such graphics-tables - add an index.yml with the packages you needs; note: if your packages need a specific repo, you can add it too. Add your new accessory on index.yml of firmares and eggs will load it, add the request repos then install yours packages.

### eggs-9.0.49-1
wardrobe: introduced accessories for costumes, you can wear a costume and choose the accessories to wear with. 
* base, 
* eggs-dev, 
* firmware

Costume hen, now specific just xfce4 configuration and take all the capabilities from base, eggs-dev and firmware. The same happen on gwaydroid and kwaydroid: both are actually using accessiries. in this case, it's evident who - a future accessory waydroid, specifyng that it's need and mantained from tha authors - can lead to a better compatibility and free us to configure it twice.

### eggs-9.0.48-1
* wardrobe: added firmwares: [drivers_wifi, codecs, drivers_various, drivers_video_nvidia, drivers_video_amd, drivers_graphics_tablet, drivers_printer, drivers_network];
* wardrobe: having a dress is pretty useless if it's not ironed, let's introduce **wardrobe ironing** to sort all sortables

### eggs-9.0.23-1
* krill: bugfix removed annoying bug on unmount process and use a more rational "press a key to exit" if we get errors.

### eggs-9.0.22-1

### eggs-9.0.19
* krill: ```eggs install --cli --crypto``` added full-crypted systems installation.

### eggs-9.0.18
* renamed blissos theme to waydroid, moved egg-of-ubuntu-impish-waydroid and egg-of-debian-bookworm-waydroid together under the same place: [waydroid](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/iso/waydroid/), due the strong affinity.

### eggs-9.0.16
* ```eggs produce``` just remove users accounts and home. This let to have working servers examples;
* ```eggs produce --backup``` remove servers and users data from live, and put them on a LUKS volume.

From version 9.0.16 we have two new commands: ```eggs syncfrom``` (alias restore) and ```eggs syncto``` (alias backup).

A working installation, can easily sync users and servers data to a luks-eggs-backup:
* ```eggs syncto -f /tmp/luks-eggs-backup``` backup users and servers data to LUKS volume /tmp/luks-eggs-backup:

A new installation, can easyly get users and servers data from a luks-eggs-backup:
* ```eggs syncfrom from -f /tmp/luks-eggs-backup``` restore users and servers data from the LUKS volume /tmp/luks-eggs-backup.

**NOTE:** 
* krill: ```sudo eggs install --cli``` will restore users and servers data automatically;
* installing with calamares: when installation is finished, you need to mount the rootdir of your installed system and, give the following command: ```sudo eggs syncfrom -f /path/to/luks-eggs-backup -r /path/to/rootdir```
* it's possbile actually to change the nest directory, editing configuration file ```/etc/penguins-eggs.d/eggs.yaml```. Example: ```set snapshot_dir: '/opt/eggs/'```, but you can't use the following: /etc, /boot, /usr and /var.

**DISCLAIM:** using this new feathures can be dangerous for your data:
* ```syncfrom``` replace all users homes and all servers homes with data from the luck-eggs-backup, Force this data in not appropriate system can easily end in a long disaster recovery;
* I want stress you again on the fact we are working with a **live filesystem** mounted binded to the **REAL filesystem**. This mean who removing a directory under the nest, usually ```/nest/ovarium/filesystem.squashfs```, mean remove it from the REAL filesystem. So, if something went wrong during the iso production and You remain with live filesystem again binded, the shortest way to solve the problem is simply reboot.

### eggs-9.0.15
--backup option: a new common command restore was added it will be be used inside krill (OK) or calamares (to do)

### eggs-9.0.14
--backup option: set minimun luks volume size to 128 MB; it's possible to move nest under /opt

### eggs-9.0.12
--backup option: save users and SERVERS datas in LUKS volume inside ISO, then can be restored by krill. 

### eggs-9.0.11
--backup option: users homes and configurations are saved in LUKS volume inside ISO, then restored by krill.

### eggs-9.0.10
From version 9.0.10, finally we can boot UEFI and standard BIOS.

### eggs-9.0.9
Great cleanup in the themes for isolinux and grub. The grub issue still remains to be solved. 

### eggs-9.0.8
Added LMDE5 elsie and a lot of work to solve UEFI problems. Not fixed yet, but you can boot setting root and prefix from grub rescue

### eggs-9.0.7
autologin and enabling desktop links on gnome

### eggs-9.0.6
Added Elemantary jolnir

### eggs-9.0.5

### eggs-9.0.3
Added linuxmint 20.3 una, added educaandos theme, bug fixex in gnome

### eggs-9.0.2
Just a little changement in splash boot and varius

### eggs-9.0.1
The first version of eggs fully functional on Debian, Devuan, Ubuntu and... Manjaro!!! And soon will come other distros of the Arch Linux family.

### eggs-9.0.0
* An Epiphany present! 

### eggs-9.0.0-BETA
* A Christmas present! 

A preview of eggs version 9.x! Even if the aspect remains substantially unchanged, internally a lot has changed: we have moved to node 16 and the new version of oclif. Everything has been done to create a way to manage even more distributions, not only Debian, Devuan, Ubuntu and derivatives, but also Fedora and Arch Linux. This version however does NOT yet include Fedora, nor Arch Linux, I have to solve the problems related to the use of dracut instead of initramfs-tools of Debian.
