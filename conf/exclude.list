# Based on:    https://git.devuan.org/devuan/refractasnapshot-base/src/branch/master/snapshot_exclude.list

# Updated for penguins-eggs - when using   eggs produce --clone
# to clone everything in /home,  including downloads, media, personal files, password files,  everything

# Location: /usr/local/share/penguins-eggs/exclude.list

# Exclude:

# SYSTEM - Exclude some system files - These are required, and you probably shouldn't change them.
# They are temporary files only created on bootup - otherwise would waste space on a clone

dev/*
cdrom/*
media/*
swapfile
sys/*
proc/*
tmp/*

# MOUNTS - temporarily mounted files, especially ones that can cause infinite looping during cloning

mnt/*

# HARDWARE dependant files - created/updated during restoration of clone  by Calamares
